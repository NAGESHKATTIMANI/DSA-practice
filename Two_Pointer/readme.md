# ðŸ§­ Two Pointers Pattern â€“ DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions and notes for **Two Pointers** problems â€” a key pattern for optimizing array and string traversal.  
Each problem is solved step-by-step with focus on **intuition**, **approach**, and **time-space analysis**.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Pattern

The **Two Pointers** technique uses two indices that move through a structure (array, string, linked list) to achieve linear-time solutions for problems involving:
- Pair comparisons
- Partitioning / segregation
- Subarray / substring checks
- Merging sorted sequences

It reduces brute-force O(nÂ²) approaches to O(n).
